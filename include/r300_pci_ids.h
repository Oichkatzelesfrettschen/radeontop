// R300-class IGP device ids (RS400/RS480/RS482/RS485).  Kept separate from
// r600_pci_ids.h because getamdgpuids.sh regenerates that file from the amdgpu
// id tables and would drop hand-maintained entries.  These parts predate
// UVD/VCE: engine-busy is read from RBBM_STATUS (0x0E40), not the R600+
// GRBM_STATUS -- see initbits() and getgrbm_pci_r300() in detect.c.
